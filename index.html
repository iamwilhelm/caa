      What is it?
    </h2>

    <p>
      CAA (Concepts, Architecture, and Algorithms) is a weekly get-together session
      amongst Pebble engineers with rotating themes of programming concepts,
      architecture, and algorithms.
    </p>

    <h2>
      <a name="why-do-we-do-it" class="anchor" href="#why-do-we-do-it"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>
      Why do we do it?
    </h2>

    <p>
      We believe that engineers like working in an environment where we're continually
      learning. To work with excellent peers is a perk in itself, and we would like to
      continually get better as programmers.
    </p>

    <p>
      The focus is to learn ideas we can carry with us, rather than things that can
      easily be made obsolete.
    </p>

      The three rotating themes
    </h2>

    <p>
      Concept sessions will be new/novel/neglected ideas in programming. There are
      many ways to program, and certain ideas expand your mind to possibilities. On
      topic examples will be promises, ruby object model, metaprogramming, functional
      reactive programming, the actor model. We will not cover how to use specific
      languages and frameworks, and those things are easily made obsolete.
    </p>

    <p>
      Architecture sessions will be where we're presented with requirements, and have
      to design the system. As the system is being designed, more requirements will be
      added, and we will try to come up with solutions to the new requirements, and see
      how that changes the design.
    </p>

    <p>
      Algorithm sessions will be where we explore a data structure, and the algorithms
      you can perform on it as a result. We will work on solving the problem together.
      These will probably mimic interview problems.

      Some general rules
    </h2>

    <p>
      Some general rules for the sessions that we've worked out so far:
    </p>

    <ol>
      <li> No power point presentations </li>
      <li> Less than 30 mins of one person talking </li>
      <li> Topics constrained to less than 1 hour of preparation </li>
      <li> Topic constrained to the main 2 or 3 points </li>
    </ol>
